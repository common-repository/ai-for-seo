== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the benefits of providing SEO metadata for my website? =
Providing SEO metadata helps search engines better understand your content, which can lead to higher rankings in search results. This improvement in visibility can drive more clicks, visitors, sales, and leads to your website.

= What are the benefits of providing alt text, titles, captions, and descriptions for images on my website? =
Including image metadata helps search engines better interpret your images, potentially boosting your rankings in image search results and the overall quality of your website. In addition, it also shows your commitment to accessibility, catering to a wider audience and complying with accessibility standards.

= How can I automate the process of generating metadata for my website? =
You can automate the generation of metadata by clicking on any content tab ('Pages,' 'Posts,' 'Products,' etc.) within the 'AI for SEO' plugin and then activating the 'Activate bulk generation' option.

= How can I automate the process of generating alt text, titles, captions, and descriptions for images on my website?
You can automate the generation of media attributes by clicking on the 'Media' tab within the 'AI for SEO' plugin and then activating the 'Activate bulk generation' option.

= Can I turn off the automation feature after I've activated it? =
Yes, just deactivate the 'Activate bulk generation' option to stop generating new metadata automatically. The same applies to the 'Activate bulk generation' option for media attributes.

= Does the bulk generation feature work for new content? =
Yes, the 'Activate bulk generation' option will generate data, both for existing content and new entries as they're created.

= Will the bulk generation feature affect existing data? =
Not by default. However, you can enable this option in the settings if needed.

= Is there any way to control what meta tags are outputted? =
Yes, in the settings, you can choose to include or exclude specific meta tags from the header output generated by our plugin. This gives you full control to customize the meta tags based on your specific requirements.

= How can I retry all failed metadata generations with just one click? =
You can find the 'Retry all failed' button in any content tab. This allows you to retry all failed metadata generations with a single click, saving you time and effort.

= Why is the automatic metadata or media attributes generation pending? =
We use WordPress's internal task scheduler to manage automatic generation efficiently. This helps prevent overloading your server with too many simultaneous tasks.

If you see a 'Pending' status in the 'SEO coverage' column, it means one of two things:

1. The plugin is waiting for the next scheduled task to run (typically within 1-5 minutes).
2. The plugin is currently generating data for other entries.

You can check the *AI for SEO* dashboard to see if any generation is in progress for other items. If many items are pending, it may take longer to process them all.

Rest assured, the plugin will automatically generate data for all pending items over time. If you need immediate results, you can use the manual generation option for specific items.

= How do I navigate to the page I want to edit for SEO? =
You can navigate to the page or post you want to edit through the normal editor, using a page builder like Elementor, or by opening the page directly in the frontend.

= Where is *AI for SEO*'s Metadata Editor located? =
You can find *AI for SEO*'s Metadata Editor button in the top admin-bar. Clicking on this will open up the metadata editor where you can modify or generate metadata.

= How can I generate or edit metadata? =
After opening *AI for SEO*'s Metadata Editor, you can either edit the existing metadata manually or generate new metadata using the 'Generate with AI' buttons.

= Will the AI tool automatically analyze my content? =
Yes, the AI tool will generate SEO-relevant data based on the content of the selected page, blog post or media file.

= Is there an alternate way to access *AI for SEO*'s Metadata Editor ? =
Yes, alternatively, you can go to the 'Pages' or 'Posts' tab within the *AI for SEO* plugin. From there, you can browse through your pages and posts, and choose the ones you want to edit.

= What editors are supported? =
We currently support Elementor, BeTheme (Muffin-Builder / Be-Builder) and the standard editor. We are working on supporting more editors.

= Are credits renewed in the Free plan? =
The free plan renews on a daily basis. You will receive 5 free credits every day, allowing you to continue using the basic features of the plugin at no cost.

= What do I need to do to receive the free daily credits? =
You don't need to do anythingâ€”they'll be automatically added to your account every day. Just make sure the plugin remains active on your website.

= Will I still receive the free daily credits if I'm on a paid plan? =
Yes, you'll continue to receive the free daily credits even if you're on a paid plan. These credits are in addition to those included in your plan.

= How are credits consumed in the *AI for SEO* plugin? =
Credits are consumed when the AI generates metadata or media attributes for your content entries. Each generation costs 5 credits, regardless of the content's word count or image size.
Please note that credits are not consumed when you manually edit the metadata or media attributes. Also, credits-wise, it does not make a difference if you only generate metadata for a single field (e.g., the title) or for all fields at once.
On the other hand, if you do not make any changes to the content, you can generate the metadata again without consuming additional credits. However, if you make changes to the content, you will need to generate the metadata again, which will consume additional credits.

= Can I try the *AI for SEO* plugin without purchasing a plan? =
Yes, the free plan provides you with 100 credits, allowing you to experiment with AI-generated SEO content without any cost. In addition, we provide you with 5 free credits every day.

= How many credits do I get with the basic, pro, and premium plans? =
- The basic plan grants you 500 credits per month, suitable for smaller websites or blogs. It covers up to ~100 content posts/pages/products/images/etc. per month.
- The pro plan grants you 1500 credits per month, designed for professionals who need more extensive SEO capabilities. It covers up to ~300 posts/pages/products/images/etc. per month.
- The premium plan grants you 5000 credits per month, ideal for businesses that require substantial SEO support and features. It covers up to ~1000 posts/pages/products/images/etc. per month.

= How do I choose the right plan for my needs? =
You should choose a plan based on the number of credits you need for generating SEO content:
- The free plan is great for experimentation. It covers up to ~20 posts/pages/products/images/etc.
- The basic plan is suitable for smaller websites or blogs. It covers up to ~100 posts/pages/products/images/etc. per month.
